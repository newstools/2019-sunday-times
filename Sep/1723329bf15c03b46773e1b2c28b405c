The JSE closed lower on Thursday, after the US Federal Reserve downplayed expectations that it may lower interest rates further after a 25-basis-point cut on Wednesday.Varying views among policy makers regarding the US interest rate decision dampened market expectations that the Fed may embark on an easing cycle. Three members voted against Wednesday’s cut with one proposing a 50-basis-point cut. The Fed cited the prolonged US-China trade war and weak global economic growth as ongoing risk factors.Locally, the Reserve Bank kept the interest rate at 6.5%, which was the consensus among 18 economists polled by Bloomberg. The Bank revised its inflation forecast for 2019 down to 4.2%, from 4.4% previously. “Barring significant shocks, monetary policy in major advanced economies will remain accommodative over the medium term. However, market expectations of further accommodation appear high, creating ongoing risk of market volatility should these not materialise,” Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago said.
