The JSE climbed along with most international equity markets on Friday, boosted by optimism over the US-China trade war, as well as upbeat economic data. Earlier, US non-farm payrolls missed market estimates, raising expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months, something that will benefit global equities and emerging-market debt. Sentiment was also lifted during the week by better-than-expected GDP data, with SA’s economy rebounding 3.1% during the second quarter. The UK parliament blocked a no-deal Brexit, while a dissipation of tension in Hong Kong also helped improve investor appetite. The primary good news, however, was that the US and China will resume high-level trade talks in October. Mid-level talks that will set the framework for those meetings are set to take place throughout September. The all share rose to 55,591.1 points and the top 40 0.2% on the day.

The court also ordered the insurer to pay costs. Sasol slumped 4% to R260.53. On Friday, the group once again delayed the release of its financial results, saying it had extended the scope of a probe into its embattled Lake Charles project in the US. Metrofile rocketed 16.97% to R1.93. It said earlier it had received a buy-out offer, but its results on Thursday had also pleased the market. Allied Electronics fell 2.32% to R24.37. It said earlier that three senior executives at one of its subsidiaries had been suspended following an investigation that revealed potential internal irregularities. Naspers gave back 0.7% to R3,565. RMB Holdings added 2.26% to R75.22. It earlier upped its dividend 7% to 376c for the year to end-June, lifted by a strong performance by FirstRand, of which it holds 34%. Sanlam added 1.48%, extending a 2.75% rise on Thursday, when it reported a 4% increase in new business volumes to R111bn in the first six months of 2019. However, headline earnings fell 31%. Focus in the week ahead is on mining and manufacturing data for July, due on Thursday and Tuesday, respectively. Mining should rise about 1.1% year-on-year in July while manufacturing should contract 1.2%, said Investec economist Lara Hodes. “The SA economy remains in a fragile state, operating against a backdrop of subdued activity and persistently low business confidence, which continues to weigh heavily on future growth prospects,” she said. GDP is unlikely to be higher than 0.7% for the year. - BusinessLIVE
