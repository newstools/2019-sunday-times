The JSE closed lower on Thursday as some global markets struggled to recover from Wednesday’s sell-off after China vowed to retaliate against US President Donald Trump’s recent tariff threat. On Thursday, China said it would take measures to respond to the 10% tariff imposition on $300bn worth of Chinese imports. The country’s foreign ministry later said, however, that China hopes to meet the US “half way” and for the two leaders to execute the agreements reached at the G20 summit in June. Global equities were hit hard on Wednesday as investors rushed to the bond market, which saw yields for longer-term government bonds push below shorter-dated ones — that is, an inverted yield curve — which is interpreted as a warning that an economic slowdown is approaching. The global sell-off was prompted by weaker-than-expected Chinese retail sales and industrial production, as well as a  slowdown in Germany’s economy activity in the second quarter of the year.
