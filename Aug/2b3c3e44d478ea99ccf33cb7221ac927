The JSE closed in positive territory on Friday, capping its best week in 12 as global markets cheered more good news in the protracted US-China trade war. China’s foreign ministry said on Friday that negotiators from both countries are maintaining “effective communication” ahead of their talks in September, Reuters reported. China said on Thursday that the US should cancel its latest tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese imports to avoid an escalation of the dispute. The rand was the third-worst performing emerging-market currency in August, behind the Mexican and Argentinian pesos. The latter was under more pressure on Friday after credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings cut the country’s debt to selective default, after its government said it would delay $7bn of payments on short-term bonds. Shortly after the JSE closed, the rand had firmed 0.71% to R15.2182/$, 1.27% to R16.7321/€, and 0.76% to R18.5335/£. The euro had weakened 0.56% to $1.10995. Even with Friday’s gain, however, August was its worst month since February, with pressure coming from the US-China trade dispute, global-recession jitters and concern over Eskom.

Import growth will be contained by still-weak domestic growth in 2019. The trade balance should, however, improve in 2019 while remaining volatile,” Nedbank Group's Economic unit said in a note. Statistics SA is set to release GDP for the second quarter on Tuesday, with economists expecting an expansion of at least 2.5%, after a contraction of 3.2% in the first quarter. - BusinessLIVE
