The Taste & Tell series is a monthly feature where the same or similar supermarket items are put to a blind taste test by a panel. (This one was made up of members of the SA Cake Decorator’s Guild.) We bought chocolate Easter eggs and marshmallow Easter eggs from five big retailers and asked our tasters to score them according to various criteria including whether or not they'd buy the product. To ensure the tasting was fair, the Easter Eggs were stripped of their packaging and numbered under the watchful eye of food expert Jenny Kay before being served to the panel. Auditor Mellicent Mashell oversaw the process and collated the scores. It's important to remember that taste is subjective and what is good for one may not be good for another. NOTE: As the Easter eggs we tasted were all different, we gave them individual scores out of 10.
