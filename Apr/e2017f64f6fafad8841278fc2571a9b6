All eyes are on a European council summit on Wednesday, where officials will consider a request from the UK to extend the Brexit deadline. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has been courting opposition counterpart Jeremy Corbyn in a bid to get a deal, saying on Sunday that "the choice that lies ahead of us is either leaving the EU with a deal, or not leaving at all", reported Dow Jones Newswires. Continuing ChinaSino-US trade talks are also being watched, amid signs the two sides are making progress. Some focus is also on local politics, which are expected to gain in importance as the May 8 election date moves closer. - BusinessLIVE
