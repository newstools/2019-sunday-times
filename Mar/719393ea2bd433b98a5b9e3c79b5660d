Twelve minutes a day may be all it takes to bring you happiness. A simple strategy, built into a daily routine, can improve your sense of well-being, say US researchers. The trick, they say, is to show compassion and empathy towards others, rather than focusing on yourself. "Walking around and offering kindness to others in the world reduces anxiety and increases happiness and feelings of social connection," said Douglas Gentile,  professor of psychology at Iowa State University. Gentile and his team found that students who were tasked with wishing others well in their thoughts as they encountered them during a 12-minute walk were far happier and felt more connected than groups who did not. "It’s a simple strategy that doesn't take a lot of time that you can incorporate into your daily activities," said Gentile. The researchers, who published their work in the Journal of Happiness Studies, found those whose thoughts focused on comparing themselves to others felt less empathetic and caring. This has particular relevance to social media engagement, said Gentile. "Our study didn’t test this, but we often feel envy, jealousy, anger or disappointment in response to what we see on social media, and those emotions disrupt our sense of well-being." This simple practice, said researcher Lanmiao He, can work for anyone, regardless of their personality type. Whether someone was more naturally empathetic or narcissistic, said He, "extending loving-kindness to others worked equally well to reduce anxiety, increase happiness, empathy and feelings of social connection".
