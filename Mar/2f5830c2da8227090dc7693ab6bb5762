Minister of public enterprises Pravin Gordhan and Eskom chairman Jabu Mabuza are holding a joint briefing on Eskom and the current electricity supply problems. On Monday, Gordhan said that load-shedding, especially stage 4 load-shedding, is "unacceptable and disruptive to our economy". "It is clear that greater urgency needs to be applied to acquire equipment necessary for urgent maintenance. We agree with South Africans that the continuation of frequent load-shedding, and in particular stage 4 load-shedding, is unacceptable and disruptive to our economy," Gordhan said. Gordhan and Eskom board members were briefed about the power supply shortages caused by problems with coal supply and the quality of coal provided to Eskom, low dam storage levels at hydro-plants, diesel supply shortages both to the country and to Eskom. They were also briefed about the collapse of power supply imported from Cahora Bassa due to cyclone Idai in Mozambique, and a large number of tube failures and breakdowns at local coal-fired power stations.
