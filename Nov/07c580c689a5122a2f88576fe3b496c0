While their significant others were muddied and bloodied on the field, the wives and girlfriends of the Springbok rugby team were scoring points on social media. And captain Siya Kolisi’s wife Rachel — with her no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is attitude — was leading the pack. Rachel let the world know her feelings when a Damian de Allende try was disallowed in the Boks’ World Cup match against Japan on October 20. She posted a picture on Instagram of herself with son Nicholas Siyamthanda in one arm and a middle finger in the air. She later wrote on Instagram: “But can we agree we all felt the same at halftime?” But can we agree we all felt the same at half time? 🙈✌🏼 A post shared by  Rachel Kolisi (@rachel_kolisi) on Oct 20, 2019 at 6:47am PDT Following the Springboks' record-equalling third Rugby World Cup win on November 2 2019, the South African rugby heroes have been celebrated across the world. From a shoutout from tennis legend Roger Federer, to Faf de Klerk's unique encounter with Prince Harry - here are some of the standout moments from the aftermath of the Springbok victory. When Kolisi ran onto the field in Saturday's final against England, he also had the support of his father Fezakele in the stands. Kolisi snr was on his first trip abroad. Rachel made the announcement on Instagram. “My dads are on their way to Japan. uTata’s first overseas trip‚ what a time to be alive‚” she wrote with a picture of her father and her father-in-law.

Social media posts show that every game began with a WAG team talk and a group prayer. But it wasn’t only the WAGS having fun. Giant lock Eben Etzebeth was surprised when he was presented with a birthday cake for his 28th birthday on Tuesday. A photo of him posing with a small cake — flanked by his much shorter teammates Cobus Reinach, Herschel Jantjies, Faf de Klerk and Cheslin Kolbe standing on chairs — was posted on the Springbok Supporters Club Facebook page. And then there was the picture that many female fans had been waiting for — one of the team shirtless in the dressing room. The Springbok scrumhalf had the world admiring his inner carefree party animal after SA's win against England in the 2019 Rugby World Cup on November 2 2019. The team defeated England 32-12 at Yokohama, Japan, to take their third Webb Ellis trophy. The champions quickly got into party mode, with Faf and the team drinking champagne from the cup and him greeting Prince Harry in colourful, patriotic undies, cheered on by his teammates.
