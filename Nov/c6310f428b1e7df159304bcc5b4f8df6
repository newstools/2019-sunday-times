The JSE ended the week lower on Friday, tracking most global markets as traders remained cautious after conflicting reports regarding the US-China trade war. Risk appetite abated after US White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said there was no agreement to withdraw tariffs on Chinese imports. That contradicted earlier reports that the two countries had agreed to roll back tariffs as part of a partial trade truce, which is expected to be signed in December. “Lower tariffs mean higher spending, higher earnings and eventually higher growth for both economies. Lower tariffs also mean massive Chinese purchases for US farmers and [much-needed] support to Donald Trump’s waning popularity,” London Capital Group senior market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya said. “Although most remain cautiously optimistic that a trade deal is still on the horizon, conflicting messages between both sides could strain investor confidence and dampen global sentiment,”  FXTM senior research analyst Lukman Otunuga said.
