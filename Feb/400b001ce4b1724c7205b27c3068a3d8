Local corporate news gave the JSE the bulk of its direction on Monday, with the platinum index faring well after a market-pleasing update from Impala Platinum. Implats jumped 9.68% to R42.50, after earlier reporting a 19% growth in platinum sales for the six months to end-December. This lifted the platinum index, although the JSE was suffering minor, but broad-based losses, on Monday morning. The closure of Chinese markets was subduing activity.
