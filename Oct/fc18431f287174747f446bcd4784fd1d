The JSE snapped a three-week losing streak on Friday, as global markets leapt on the news that talks between the US and China over their trade impasse are progressing well. China and the US are in their second day of discussions to end their 15-month trade war, which has come at a great cost to the global economy.

This is the second consecutive week of gains for the rand, which reached its best level in three weeks. It is now up 2.68% to the dollar in October, its biggest gain since June. TreasuryONE senior dealer Andre Botha said, “Markets have been buoyed by the China-US trade talks seeming to be progressing well and positive Brexit news.” He added that gold had “slipped a little” as investors moved out of safe-haven assets.
