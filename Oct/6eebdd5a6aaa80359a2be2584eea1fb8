The JSE closed higher on Wednesday, with gold miners leading gains, while the rand pared some losses after weakening through the R15/$ level for the first time this week. The local currency weakened to as much as R15.05/$ in intra-day trade after Eskom said it would implement stage two load-shedding, which has worsened investors’ fears about the state of the power utility. “The concern is not directly related to the load-shedding but rather what the uncertainty means for Eskom. It was not forecast that they would be any supply constraints and, coupled with the precarious financial position, it creates uncertainty,” said Mercato Financial Services analyst Nico Du Plessis. “Eskom forms a vital part of any economic growth in SA and concerns will directly affect the medium-term budget policy statement (MTBPS) and the perception of the credit rating agencies.” At 5.30pm, the rand had weakened 0.3% to R14.9304/$, 0.56% to R16.5153/€, and 0.67% to R19.1627/£. The euro was up 0.27% to $1.1062. Gold rose 0.42% to $1,487.22/oz and platinum 0.42% to $884.94. Brent crude added 0.73% to $59.27 a barrel. Retail sales growth slowed to 1.1% in August from 2% in July, data from Statistics SA showed on Wednesday. The median forecast was for a rise of 1.7%, according to Bloomberg. Global markets were mixed on Wednesday as investors await further direction regarding the Brexit deal and the US-China trade war, amid fears that these geopolitical issues will continue to weigh on global growth. Head of G10 strategy at Standard Bank Steven Barrow told Business Day TV on Wednesday that he is not pricing in the likelihood of a global recession in 2019 after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its global growth forecast to a decade low. Barrow said the US may be a little “immune” to some of the risks to growth and it is likely to avoid a recession, while countries that are most affected by trade, such as the UK and Germany, are close to experiencing a recession. Markets have partially priced in a third interest-rate cut this year from the US Federal Reserve amid fears the slowing US economy.
