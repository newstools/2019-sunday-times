The JSE closed in negative territory on Thursday for a second  consecutive day as investors worry about global economic growth, while markets await labour data from the US. Markets will be watching US non-farm payrolls for September, which will be released  on Friday.

This follows the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) approval for the US to impose duties on $7.5bn worth of EU goods. Shortly after the JSE closed, the Dow was flat at 26,093.43  points.
