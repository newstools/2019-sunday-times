The JSE suffered its third consecutive weekly drop on Friday, as fears about the state of the global economy weighed on investor sentiment following the release of more poor economic data. US non-farm payrolls for September came in lower than expected on Friday. The data is considered an important indicator of the health of the world’s largest economy. Non-farm payrolls increased by 136,000 from 165,000 in the previous month but below expectations of 145,000 according to Trading Economics.The latest figure and poor manufacturing data released this week have further supported expectations that the US Federal Reserve may cut interest rates at their last two meetings for 2019. “[US Federal Reserve chair Jerome] Powell may choose to wait to see what happens with next week’s high-level trade talks before committing to more easing. The narrative is not as clear as he may have preferred: the trend in job growth is clearly in deceleration mode and wage growth is at its lowest level in a year, but the unemployment rate just hit a fresh 50-year low,” said Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya. “The data-dependent Fed has enough ammunition to commit to another rate cut, but they could still hold off on committing to an easing cycle,” Moya said. A cut from the Fed may allow room for the SA Reserve Bank to cut the repo rate as the local economy is forecast to grow by just 0.6% in 2019, according to the Bank.
