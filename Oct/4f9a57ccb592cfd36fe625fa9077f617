The rand was firmer against the pound on Thursday evening, as markets digest news that the EU and Britain have reached a deal on the latter’s exit from the EU. At a meeting on Thursday, the EU and Britain agreed on a Brexit deal, three years after the UK voted to leave the regional bloc. The deal still needs to be approved by both the UK and EU parliaments. Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said earlier on Thursday that it would not support the Brexit plan. “Anyone hoping that the process will be straightforward now is kidding themselves,” senior market analyst at Oanda Craig Erlam said. “With the Labour Party whipping for a second referendum on the deal and the Liberal Democrats unlikely to support anything, there is still a good chance we’re heading for an extension and election = to get this over the line. Nothing in Brexit is ever simple.” At 5.23pm, the rand had firmed 0.79% to R19.021/£, shedding some gains after earlier reaching R18.9518.
