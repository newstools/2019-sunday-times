Cape Town has been voted the best city to visit in 2019 in the Africa and Middle East region by Travel + Leisure readers - for a breathtaking 18th time in the annual survey. The city's tourism bosses, businesses and residents keep attracting tourists because of a strong sense of historical and cultural identity, beautiful scenery, good food and shopping, and world-class hotels.
