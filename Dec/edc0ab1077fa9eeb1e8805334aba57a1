The JSE tracked global markets higher on Friday, after US non-farm payrolls climbed to a 10-month high, easing concern that the world’s largest economy is slowing down. The labour data, which is considered a crucial indicator of the state of the US economy, rose by 266,000 in November from 156,000 in October. The latest figure is above market expectations of 180,000, according to Trading Economics. On the trade-war front, White House national economic council director Larry Kudlow said on Friday that the US and China are close to reaching a trade deal but that the former could “walk away” if their terms are not met, CNBC reported. China’s foreign ministry said on Friday that it will waive import tariffs on some soybeans and pork from the US. The markets were mainly driven by conflicting messages from the US and China this week. Earlier, US President Donald Trump said the trade war may only be resolved after the 2020 US elections, despite reports that negotiators from the two economic superpowers were maintaining close communication.

Earlier, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.43%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng 1.07% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 0.23%. The rand recorded its second week of gains against the dollar, driven by trade-war optimism, which was somewhat offset by a negative GDP print earlier in the week.

The oil price has been supported by oil cartel Opec’s decision to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to at least March 2020. After the Opec and Opec+ meetings, Saudi Arabia’s Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the country would continue its voluntary cut of 400,000 bpd, which saw oil prices jump in New York.
