MTN said on Tuesday it would sell its interest in investment fund Amadeus to private equity firm HarbourVest for around R1.2 billion ($83 million). MTN said the sale, which also includes its associated holding in online travel booking website TravelStart, was part of a plan to realise R15 billion worth of capital over the next three years, simplify its portfolio and reduce risk.
